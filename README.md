Nobility is a barebones repair tracking system. No frills, no customer interaction, no complications; just repairs.

To install, clone to somewhere convenient where you have permissions, and run ```source makefil```. It's not a true ```makefile```, so you can't run ```make```. I might fix that at some point.

To add new devices, change the contencts of ```longLists.py```, using the other entries in that file as a guide.
