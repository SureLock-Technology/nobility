Nobility is a barebones repair tracking system. No frills, no customer interaction, no complications; just repairs.

To install, clone to somewhere convenient where you have permissions, and run ```source setup.sh```.

To add new devices, change the contencts of ```longLists.py```, using the other entries in that file as a guide.
